## Getting Started
[Style Guide](https://roblox.github.io/lua-style-guide/)

Uninstall Foreman if you have it installed, it's not needed anymore. Install the latest release of Aftman from [here](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman/releases). Once installed, run `aftman install` in the project directory to install dependencies. Then, run `./wallyinstall` to install any packages we may use. Now you should be set.
